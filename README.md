# catalog
catalog for my dad's large collection of cds

You can view and edit the catalog. That's about it, thanks for watching.

I initially wanted this to be run through a Python script (which is still in
this repo), but shortly after I started I realized that a website would be more
user and dad-friendly.

Uses Slidebars for the menu and jQuery for other things.

You do *not* have to run `npm update` because everything (execept jQuery, which
comes from Google) is now in the assets folder. This is so that it works on
GitHub Pages.

Speaking of GitHub Pages, you can see the example catalog
[here](https://schobbish.github.io/catalog). You can't add, edit, or delete
entries from the catalog because that uses PHP, but everything else uses JS.
